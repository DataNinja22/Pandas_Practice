# Pandas Case Studies and Methods

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and datasets focused on learning and mastering the pandas library for data analysis in Python. The materials are organized to help you understand key pandas concepts, methods, and real-world case studies.

## Contents

- **Dataframe_methods.ipynb**: Demonstrates important DataFrame and Series methods with examples and comments.
- **DataFrame.ipynb**: Covers DataFrame creation, attributes, selection, filtering, and math methods.
- **Series.ipynb**: Explains pandas Series, creation, indexing, editing, and useful methods.
- **Group_by_Objects.ipynb**: GroupBy operations and aggregation techniques.
- **Merging_joining.ipynb**: Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames.
- **Multiindex.ipynb**: MultiIndexing and hierarchical data in pandas.
- **DataSets/**: Contains various CSV and Excel files used in the notebooks for hands-on practice.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.
3. Run the cells and explore the code, comments, and outputs.
4. Use the datasets in the `DataSets` folder for your own experiments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (for plotting, if used)

Install requirements using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Learning Goals

- Understand the core pandas data structures: Series and DataFrame.
